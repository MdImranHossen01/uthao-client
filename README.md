## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive frontend application that consumes the Uthao Parcel Delivery API. It provides a seamless and responsive user interface for three distinct user roles: **Admins**, **Senders**, and **Receivers**. The application features a public-facing website with service information and a secure, protected dashboard with tailored functionality for each authenticated user.

State management and API communication are handled robustly by Redux Toolkit and RTK Query, ensuring a predictable state container and efficient data fetching with automatic caching and UI updates.
